# Financial Modeling
This playlist was part of a visiting lectures series at Trinity College Dublin on Financial Modelling and Scenario Analysis. Most of the teaching was face-to-face in April 2022 and 2023. However, I have done a few recordings, which I share on my YouTube channel @YUNIKARN. A more recent course on Company Valuation: A Guide for Analysts, Investors, and CEOs: (54 lectures + 4 assignments = 8.5 hours content) is available on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/company-valuation-a-guide-for-analysts-investors-and-ceos/?referralCode=FC67D2F6397D78F56448
