# Financial Modeling
This playlist was part of a visiting lectures series at Trinity College Dublin on Financial Modelling and Scenario Analysis. Most of the teaching was face-to-face in April 2022 and 2023. However, I have done a few recordings, which I share on my YouTube channel @YUNIKARN. A more recent course on Company Valuation: A Guide for Analysts, Investors, and CEOs: (54 lectures + 4 assignments = 8.5 hours content) is available on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/company-valuation-a-guide-for-analysts-investors-and-ceos/?referralCode=FC67D2F6397D78F56448

# Unit 6: Discounted Cash Flow Model (DCF)
We develop the Discounted Cash Flow Model (DCF), which is the main tool for valuing companies. Understanding the mechanics of DCF is an essential skill in financial analysis.

# Unit 7: Forecasting cash flows
A DCF model is useless without forecasted free cash flows. But how can we forecast free cash flows? This video explores a common approach based on revenue forecasts and ratios.
